This folder contains all the code I used for the core analysis of my thesis. 
Mind the notes I added all over within each script. 

The scripts should be run in the following order (at least the first time)
1. dataNAMES
2. prepareData.R
3. If forging BSgenome is desired/preferred using the Bioconductor manual and it's necessary: 
 a) run individual code of "forgeBSgenome2_Cheetah.R"" or the corresponding one
 or 
 b) run the same code found within the script "Annot_Fx_analysis.R"
4. medipAnalysisAdd_AciJub.R
5. medipProcessing_AciJub.R
At this point can either run: 
6a annotateDMRs_AciJub.R IF someone manages to make it work 
6b proceed with medipReport.Rmd and its associated files 
6c proceed to "Annot_Fx_analysis.R" which contains most donwstream analysis to MEDIPS package. 
7. Look at the plotting options I used and run if appropriate using "plots.R"

The "add_annot_opts.Rmd" includes fail attempts but might be useful if interested in further annotation
options. 

I didn't use nor altered the script "publicationFiles.R". 

NOTE1: When a new analysis needs to be run create a brand-new directories to avoid confusion! :)

NOTE2: Please do not delete files that do not contain code because they belong to built in packages and I
am very scared that if they go away something won't work (e.g. NCBI.sqlite, genes2go, etc.)
